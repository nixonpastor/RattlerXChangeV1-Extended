* we could technically work on the master branch but i'll look into it * 

ORDER of git

1. open the project inside Visual Studio Code and open the terminal in 
Visual Studio Code (make sure you are inside the project folder when the terminal opens
and not on desktop or anywhere else.
ex this is mine in the terminal for VSC(at the bottom of VSC):
RattlerXChangeV1-Extended nixonpastor$ )

2. git pull 
(do this as the first thing when you open the
project BEFORE coding or making changes to files
to get most current version of project)

3. git status 
(Checks the status of the files if modified and gives you the 
files that have not been tracked by git, visual studio code terminal should show
files in red that were add/changed but not saved to the repo )

4. git add . 
(Adds all the files that were NOT tracked to be tracked, 
Saves the changes) 
OR
git add file.js 
(adding specific files to save the changes, 
file.js is just an example of file)

5. git status 
(this step is to just check if the file/files you added were actually
saved, should appear as green on visual studio terminal)

6. git commit -m "MESSAGE GOES HERE" 
(commits the changes you made and please 
insert message of what you changed or did inside the quotes)

7. git push 
(pushes/sends the files you changed to the repository in github)

8. start from step 2 when making more changes

(if someone added a file, we can do git pull to get the file on our local repo)
